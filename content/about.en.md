Recently, meal delivery platforms have multiplied in large cities.
<br>
Their strategy ? A rapid and exponential growth to grab the market,
and eventually to establish a monopoly by buying back its competitors.
They all share one thing in common: using **self-contractors** to ensure deliveries.

This is called _uberization_: connecting consumers and "service providers" through a web platform.
<br>
"Providers" are not employed by the firm holding the platform.
This situation benefits the firm in two different ways : they represent an extremely flexible and inexpensive workforce,
and they carry the financial risk instead of the firm.

The individual entrepreneur model is now being generalized to the whole society. Individuals are more and more isolated and losing their protections against all sorts of risks (such as work accidents and unemployment).

**But it is not a fatality**

✊  Most of the added value and network effects are created by "providers" and platform users

✊  Platforms are nothing but computer code running on servers

Through the digital economy, we may have a chance to socialize the production capacities on a large scale, setting up platforms under the legal status of the **cooperative**.

**Let's try!**

Other people have the same idea in different activities, such as [music streaming](https://resonate.is/) or [microblogging](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree / 2016 / September / 29 / save-twitter-buy-platform-shared-ownership).

In order to promote the emergence of cooperative platforms in the delivery sector,
we decided to create an **open-source** software,
based on reciprocity: you have to organize as a cooperative to commercialize it.

The idea is that the platform is a common good, which means it belongs to no one, because anyone can use it. Those who use it have a vested interest in maintaining it.

The explosion of bicycle delivery is a boon for the development of clean urban logistics.
<br>
The cooperative appears to us as a good way to make this local and non-delocalisable activity sustainable.
