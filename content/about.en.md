In recent years, meal delivery platforms have multiplied in large cities.
<br>
The strategy ? Rapid and exponential growth to occupy the market,
in the hope of obtaining a monopoly and buying back its competitors.
They all have one thing in common: using **self-contractors** to ensure deliveries.

This is called _uberization_: connect consumers and "service providers" through a web platform.
<br>
"Providers" are not employed by the platform that provides the service,
which makes it possible to have an extremely flexible and inexpensive workforce,
and outsourcing risks.

The model of the individual entrepreneur is generalized to the whole of society.
<br>
Individuals are more isolated and less well protected, and have more difficulty regrouping.

**But it is not inevitable**

Through the digital economy, we may have a chance to socialize the means of production on a large scale, setting up platforms under the legal status of the **cooperative**.

**Let's try!**

We are not the only ones to think that this is possible, including for [music](https://resonate.is/) or [microblogging](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree / 2016 / September / 29 / save-twitter-buy-platform-shared-ownership).

In order to encourage the emergence of cooperative platforms in the delivery sector,
we decided to create a ** open-source ** software,
based on reciprocity: you can use it if you organize yourself as a cooperative.

The idea is that the platform is a common good, that is, a good that belongs to no one, because it belongs to everyone. Those who use it have a vested interest in maintaining it.

The explosion of bicycle delivery is a boon for the development of clean urban logistics.
<br>
The cooperative seems to us a good way to make this local and non-delocalisable activity sustainable.
