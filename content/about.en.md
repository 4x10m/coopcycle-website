In 2016, the so-called collaborative economy began to show its limits: the company Take Eat Easy was placed in judicial liquidation, the strikes of the drivers of VTC multiplied, the working conditions of foodtech workers were denounced.

It is time to regain power, to create a fairer Internet, more concerned about its users, and respectful of social rights.

## Towards a platform cooperativism</h2>

In September 2016, Nathan Schneider proposed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/save-twitter-buy-platform-shared-ownership" target="_blank">buy Twitter by its users</a>,

Why not?

The platforms of the sharing economy are presented as mere actors of relationship, and flee their social responsibilities.
It is up to the workers on the platforms to decide on working conditions, tariffs and schedules, on a democratic and open model: this model exists, it is the cooperative.
We believe that it is possible to easily create an open-source clone of the foodtech platforms, offering the same level of quality, in order to offer the possibility to cooperatives of workers to set up.



## Think smaller, think local

By 2030, the Web alone could represent the equivalent of the 2008 world energy consumption.
Recently, W3C launched the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wwca/">Web We Can Afford</a> working group,
to address these issues in the context of the upcoming energy crisis.

We believe that the delivery of meals by bike is a local activity, specific to each city.
It is possible to relocate this type of activity in the form of cooperatives, each cooperative hosting the platform on its own.
This should drastically reduce infrastructure costs and therefore energy consumption, while avoiding the centralization of data.
