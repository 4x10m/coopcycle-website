#### What is CoopCycle?

**CoopCycle** is above all an **open-source software** to run a logistics platform, with usage restrictions through its [reciprocity license](http://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License). Its main restriction is that you need to be organized as a worker-owned co-op to run it commercially.
<br>
We see the platform as a **common good**, which is owned and managed by the workers (couriers, restaurant owners) who are using it.

It is also a **political tool**: we are lobbying against uberization through articles and conferences. We are trying to build an alternative economic model to the foodtech giants. We try to rally couriers from France and Belgium around this political and technological tool that is CoopCycle.

#### I am a courier, what are the benefits of Coopcycle ?

Co-ops allows workers to enjoy all the benefits of the salary combined with those of independence. We believe that foodtech workers should have stable income and protection (accident, illness, paid leave…). As co-operators, workers take part in the technical and commercial decisions.

#### I am a restaurant-owner, what are the benefits of using Coopcycle ?

Depending on the legislation of the country, restaurant owners & shopkeepers would have the opportunity to regain control by **being associated with the decisions** that are made by the co-op running & using the platform.
<br>
For example, we (couriers and restaurant owners) could decide together a fair commission price.

#### Are you a startup?
**No**, right now we are an non-profit organization, we are working on the creation of a co-op in Paris.

#### Is it ready? Can I order meals on your platform?
**Not yet**. The code to run the platform is [actively developed](https://github.com/coopcycle/coopcycle-web/pulse/monthly). We are targeting a v1 release date in the **1rst quarter of 2018**. But the code is only one part of the project. You can already have an overview of the user interface (customer and restaurant) on our demo site: https://demo.coopcycle.org . At the same time, we are building the cooperative in Paris and gathering with collectives who want to launch their own co-op !  

**If you are speaking about the software**

We are targeting a launch in spring 2018.
<br>
The more contributors, the faster the project will be operational. <br>
However, the association that carries the project wants to properly structure the software, its modalities of use and governance.

**If you want to start working as a co-operator**

Foodtech workers are gathering into new kind of unions in every major city.
<br>
This is a good starting point! Join or create your city's union and send us an email, we are here to facilitate.

**If you want to deliver your products in an equitable way**

Contact your city's bikers collective and/or send us an email, we are here to facilitate.

**If you want to order a meal**

More informations about your city are coming soon…

#### Are you using blockchain?

**No**, we are not using blockchain, but standard web technologies. Of course, we are definitely interested in blockchain and all the possibilities it brings in terms of decentralization & ownership. But we think we don't need to use blockchain to achieve our goal. We also want to allow as many developers as possible to contribute, from experts to beginners.

#### How is it pronounced?

It is pronounced **[koʊˌɑp saɪkəl]**
<br>
As you may have guessed, the first four letters mean « co-op », so please do not say **[kuːp]**
