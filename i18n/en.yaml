      The code is <strong>open-source</strong> and <strong>free to use</strong> by worker-owned courier co-ops.

      Organize, we provide the technology!

    We believe it is possible to organize at a city level in the form of a co-operative of couriers,
    and provide a human-scale, environmentally conscious urban logistics service.
    <br><br>
    We create an order/dispatch system that you can set up and <strong>host yourself</strong>,
    on your own server, and a smartphone app that will allow connecting to any server running the platform.
    <br><br>
    We want, through local collective experiences, to build a knowledge base that will allow the model
    to be replicated easily.

    We want to provide those who organize themselves with a technological base, without any prior investment in research and development.

    The only thing we ask for in return? <strong>Create a worker owned co-operative.</Strong> The code is licensed under a
    <a href="https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License">reciprocity license</a>,
    which means that it can only be used commercially by a company owned by its workers, where all profits are shared between worker-owners.
    <br><br>
    The code is <a href="https://github.com/coopcycle">available on GitHub</a>. You want to contribute to the opensource project? Contact us at <a href="mailto:dev@coopcycle.org">dev[at]coopcyle.org</a>.

    Below, a random order is created every 10 minutes.

    Bots use the CoopCycle platform to dispatch orders.
