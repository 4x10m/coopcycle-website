    We believe it is possible to organize at a city level in the form of a co-operative of couriers,
    and provide a human-scale, environmentally conscious urban logistics service.
    <br><br>
    We create an order/dispatch system that you can set up and <strong>host yourself</strong>,
    on your own server, and a smartphone app that will allow connecting to any server running the platform.
    <br><br>
    We want, through local collective experiences, to build a knowledge base that will allow the model
    to be replicated easily.

    <br>
    <strong>Create a worker owned co-operative.</Strong>
